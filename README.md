Tableau for Analytics and Data Interpretation

1. In the Tableau public edition under the connect, select Text and open the csv file.
2. To start analyzing the data, click on sheet1
3. Tableau divides your content types (that is, your columns) into dimensions and measures. Measures generally consist of numeric information: values that can be added together. Dimensions are categorical: they’re ways to divide up your data.
4. One way to figure out if your data type is a dimension or a measure is to ask, does it make sense to add these up? For example, it makes sense to add up applicants’ funding levels (measure), but not their zip codes (dimension)! Zip codes are numbers, but they aren’t measures.
5. To recategorize this data type, click on the field name to reveal the context menu. Then select Convert to Dimension.
6. House District & Senate Districts converted to columns.
7. select any column dimension ( column) to the canvas.
8. Tableau doesn't know at this point what to do with it. if you want to group by the values, you have to give the data to count
9. We want Tableau to create a chart that visualizes the number of grants awarded per arts discipline. In order to do that, we need Tableau to count up the values for each category
10. Drag and Drop!
